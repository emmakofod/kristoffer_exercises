Exercise 13 — Ransomware Handling Procedure

Choose a procedure to handle ransomware. Research and select a procedure you like. Describe that procedure. Explain your choice.


**Chosen procedure: NIST Incident Response + 3-2-1 Backup Strategy**

Combine the NIST Cybersecurity Framework incident response steps with concrete 3-2-1 backup strategy => cover all 3 defence steps: prevent, detect, and recover.

## Phase 1 — Preparation (Prevent)

- Keep all systems patched and up to date
- Enforce least privilege
- Segment the network -> ransomware spreading laterally hits -- targets
- Train users to recognise phishing (the 1st entry point)
- Deploy EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) on all machines
- Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule:

    - 3 copies of data
    - 2 different media types (e.g. disk + cloud)
    - 1 copy completely offline / air-gapped


## Phase 2 — Detection & Analysis (Detect)

- Monitor logs for unusual file access patterns
- Alert on processes accessing large numbers of files rapidly
- Use IDS/SIEM to detect unusual network traffic
- Early warning signs: CPU spike, file extensions changing, shadow copies being deleted

## Phase 3 — Containment

- Isolate affected machines immediately = disconnect from network
- Do NOT shut down immediately (volatile memory may contain the encryption key)
- Preserve forensic evidence -> take a memory dump if possible
- Identify patient zero and the attack vector

## Phase 4 — Eradication

- Wipe affected systems completely => do not try to clean them
- Rebuild from known-good images
- Patch the vulnerability that was exploited

## Phase 5 — Recovery

- Restore data from the offline/air-gapped backup
- Test the backup in a sandbox first to verify it is clean and not infected
- Restore in order of business priority (critical servers first)
- Monitor closely after restoration for signs of re-infection (persistence mechanisms)

## Phase 6 — Post-Incident

- Write an after-action report
- Identify what failed and fix it
- Update detection rules based on the attack


**Why I chose this procedure**
- The NIST approach is well-established and used by organisations globally
    => it covers all three defence steps: prevent, detect, recover.

- The most critical element is the offline backup. Network-connected backups are often encrypted by ransomware too.
    => An air-gapped or immutable backup is the one thing that guarantees recovery without paying the ransom.

- The NSG ex shows what happens when detection is slow: one month of undetected access cost $1.5M to recover from, even without paying the ransom.
    => Fast detection + tested backups = the difference between a bad day and a catastrophe.

- The procedure should complement other defences, not replace them    
    =>just like host firewalls and gateway firewalls complement each other.
