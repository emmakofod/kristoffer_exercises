Exercise 2.5.a
• Linux local file system.
• Research and explain the contents of:
- `/`: Root of everything. All other directories branch from here.
- `/bin`: Essential binaries all users can run :`ls`, `cp`, `cat`.
- `/sbin`: System binaries for root/admin :`fdisk`, `reboot`.
- `/usr`: Secondary hierarchy for non-essential programs.
- `/usr/bin`: Programs for regular users :`python3`, `git`, `nano`.
- `/usr/sbin`: Non-essential admin tools :`apache2`, `useradd`.
- `/home`: Personal folders for each user. My stuff lives in `/home/emma`.
- `/etc`: System-wide config files : `passwd`, `hosts`, `sshd_config`.
- `/dev`: Hardware represented as files :`/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`.
- `/tmp`:Temporary files, wiped on reboot.
- `/var`: Data that changes constantly : logs, mail spools.
- `/lib`: Shared libraries that binaries depend on. Like `.dll` on Windows.
- `/mnt`: Mount point for external drives and network shares.




Exercise 2.5.b
• From the Linux101 in the network class.
– Show and explain usage of:
- `man`: Shows the manual for a command. `man ls`
- `file`: Tells you what type a file is without relying on the extension.
- `cat`: Prints a file's contents to the terminal.
- `less`: Like `cat` but scrollable. Press `q` to quit.
- `|`: Pipes output from one command into another. `cat file | grep "error"`
- `>`: Redirects output to a file. `echo "hello" > file.txt`
- `echo`: Prints text to the terminal. `echo "hello"`
- `head`: Shows the first 10 lines of a file.
- `tail`: Shows the last 10 lines. Useful for live logs with `tail -f`.
- `grep`: Searches for a pattern in text. `grep "error" log.txt`
- `wc`: Word/line/character count. `wc -l file.txt` counts lines.
- `sort`: Sorts lines alphabetically or numerically.
- `uniq`: Removes duplicate consecutive lines. Usually paired with `sort`.




Exercise 2.5.c
• Try and explain below commands:

- `echo danmark er dejligt`: Prints "danmark er dejligt" to the terminal.
- `passwd`: Change your password.
- `date`: Shows the current date and time.
- `hostname`: Shows the machine's hostname.
- `arch`: Shows the CPU architecture, e.g. `x86_64`.
- `uname -a` :Shows all system info — kernel, hostname, OS, architecture.
- `dmesg | more`: Shows kernel boot messages, one page at a time.
- `uptime`: How long the system has been running and current load.
- `whoami`:Prints your current username.
- `who`: Shows who is currently logged in.
- `id`:Shows your user ID, group ID and group memberships.
- `pwd`: Print Working Directory — shows where you are in the file system.
- `apropos` :Searches man page descriptions by keyword. `apropos network`
- `whereis ifconfig`: Finds the binary, source and man page for a command.
- `find / -type f -name ifconfig 2>/dev/null` : Searches the whole file system
  for a file named `ifconfig`. `2>/dev/null` hides permission errors.
- `which`: Shows the full path of a command. `which python3`
- `last`: Shows a history of who logged in and when.
- `finger` : Shows info about a user. Often not installed by default.
- `w` :Like `who` but with more detail — what each user is currently doing.
- `top`: Live view of running processes and resource usage. `q` to quit.
- `echo $SHELL` :Prints which shell you're using, e.g. `/bin/bash`.
- `man ls`: Opens the manual page for `ls`.
- `who can tell me why i am broke`: Not a real command. Returns "command not found".
- `lost`: Not a real command. Returns "command not found".
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
- `cal` :Shows a calendar for the current month.
- `cal 2022` : Shows the full calendar for 2022.
- `cal 9 2022`: Shows September 2022.
- `yes please` :`yes` prints a string repeatedly forever. `please` is the
  argument so it just prints "please" until you hit `Ctrl+C`.
- `time sleep 5`: Runs `sleep 5` (waits 5 seconds) and reports how long it took.
- `history`: Shows your command history.



Exercise 2.5.d
• File handling. Use cp command.
• Make a directory /exercise2.5/test2
• Create a few txt files in this directory
– Copy one file from /exercise2.5/test2 to exercise2.5/test1
– Copy all file from test2 to test1 (use the –r option)
– Copy all txt files from test1 to test2 directory.





Exercise 2.5.e
• File handling. Use mv command.
• Make a directory /exercise2.5/test2
• Create a few txt files in this directory
– Move all txt files from /exercise2.5/test2 to exercise2.5/test1
– Move all files with names beginning with a from test1 to test2
– Update some file content. Then move all files from test2 to test1 only
if they are newer.
– Create a few new files in test2. Now move all files from test1 to test2,
and if override then make backups
– Rename all files beginning with ”a” to names beginning with ”bob”
– Rename all files that contain a ”1” to contain ”one”
– Remove a file.
– Remove a directory.
– Experiment on your own.
